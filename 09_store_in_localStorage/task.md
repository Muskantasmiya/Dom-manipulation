Task details

Deliverable:

The form inside the index.html file is already provided by us. Your task is to store all the user details as an object inside the local storage, instead of storing them as individual fields. For this you can take help of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUOzvFzdIk4

NOTE: Make sure that when you are storing data in the local storage the key that you use is "User Details". The key has to be "User Details" only then the test cases will pass.

If you are getting any errors try debugging the error, after all no one becomes a developer without making mistakes and then debugging. Watch this video to understand the different ways of debugging.

Push the code to GitHub.
